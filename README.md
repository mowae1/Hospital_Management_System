# Hospital_Management_System
This project automates patient management workflows for the OpenMRS hospital system using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. It includes:

Login Automation: Secure authentication into the system.
Patient Registration: Uses JavaFaker to generate random patient names, genders, birthdates, and contact details.
Appointment Scheduling: Requests appointments for hospital departments.
Patient Visit Management: Searches for patients, starts visits, records vital signs, and updates medical status.
File Attachment Handling: Automates file uploads for patient records.
Visit Termination: Ends patient visits with confirmation.
The project enhances efficiency in hospital system testing by incorporating dynamic data entry, real-time element handling, and automated workflows.
